The _Cosmic Computation Laboratory_ is a worker-owned technology research studio being germinated by [J.H. Gold](https://twitter.com/jongold) & an organic global motley crew of artists, musicians, lightworkers, computer-hippies, hippie-hippies & all-around creative enigmas from Portland to Amsterdam.

We are planting seeds, building experimental creative tooling for high-vibrational artists & musicians, researching resilient P2P information tools for a post-capitalist era, and using our work to model our utopian ethics.

We have deep expertise in [anti-disciplinary](https://joi.ito.com/weblog/2014/10/02/antidisciplinar.html) design, full-stack web & mobile development, and more creative programming paradigms than you can shake a roll of WS2812Bs at.

You can hire us via [email](mailto:gold@cosmiccomputation.org), or dream of a better world with us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/4FbJvH). We also have a [newsletter](https://tinyletter.com/cosmic) for occasional updates, Joseph Campbell quotes, & vibes.

In light & love; together,
